This web application provides access to various statistical diagrams which can give you an insight about a selected past iRacing session. These diagrams are interactive and can be manipulated in various ways (such as dragging and zooming). Additionally, you can access more information by hovering over the elements (i.e. median, mean or single data points). Currently, the only type of diagram implemented is the box plot.

The implemented features are as follows and can be activated or deactivated via the sidebar:
- display disconnected or disqualified drivers
- display each individual lap
- compare laptimes of the same lap over all drivers
- highlight the absolute fastest lap
- highlight personal best laps
- highlight laps with incidents (as defined by iRacing)
- display the mean
- display all car classes (in multiclass races)
- sort drivers from fastest to slowest (based on median)

Feel free to explore these features and analyze your iRacing data! 🏎️📊
